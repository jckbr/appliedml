This repo showcases three different projects completed as part of a university class in Summer 2021

Each project folder has a readme.md file describing what the project does/shows

I took this course at the same time as [dsfoundations](https://github.com/jckbr/dsfoundations)and it was a perfect pairing. Both classes overlapped in terms of topics and projects, especially on the data importing and usage aspects. I highly recommend this class along with dsfoundations because they pair great and are a very hot area currently

This class was very interesting to me in the sense of teaching computers "learn". I then took [theoryofai](https://github.com/jckbr/theoryofai)in Winter 2022 because I wanted to learn more about how computers can learn.

Figures will be added eventually
